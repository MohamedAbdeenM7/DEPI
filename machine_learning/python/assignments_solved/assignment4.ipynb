    "#### Task 1 – <b>(Simple Calculator Program)</b> \n",
    "Objective:<br>\n",
    "Develop a Python program that acts as a simple calculator. The program should allow the user to<br>\n",
    "choose an arithmetic operation and apply it to two numbers entered by the user.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Description<br>\n",
    "The program is menu-driven and performs basic arithmetic operations using separate functions for<br>\n",
    "each operation. The user selects an operation, enters two numbers, and the program displays the <br>\n",
    "calculated result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements \n",
    "1. Define arithmetic functions <br>\n",
    "Create separate functions for: <br>\n",
    "o Addition <br>\n",
    "o Subtraction <br>\n",
    "o Division <br>\n",
    "o Multiplication <br>\n",
    "2. Display a menu <br>\n",
    "o Show a menu that allows the user to choose one of the available operations. \n",
    "3. User input <br>\n",
    "o Ask the user to enter: <br>\n",
    "o The desired operation <br>\n",
    "o Two numeric values <br>\n",
    "4. Perform the calculation <br>\n",
    "o Call the appropriate function based on the user’s choice. <br>\n",
    "o Handle invalid operation selections.<br> \n",
    "5. Display the result <br>\n",
    "o Print the result of the selected operation clearly. \n",
    "6. Main program execution <br>\n",
    "o Use a main() function. <br>\n",
    "o Ensure the program runs only <br> when executed directly. <br>\n",
    "<b>Notes</b> <br>\n",
    "• The program should use functions to <br> keep the code organized. <br>\n",
    "• User input must be converted to <br> numerical values before calculations. <br>\n",
    "• The output should clearly show the result."

    "#### Task 2 – <b>(Thanos Project)</b>  \n",
    "Objective: \n",
    "Create a Python function that performs a series of file and folder operations,<br>\n",
    "inspired by the \n",
    "concept of “Thanos” randomly removing half of the files.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements \n",
    "Write a function that does the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a folder \n",
    "o Access an existing folder on your system. \n",
    "2. Create files inside the folder \n",
    "o Generate a specified number of files inside the folder. \n",
    "3. Count the files \n",
    "o Check and display the total number of files in the folder. \n",
    "4. Delete half of the files randomly \n",
    "o Randomly select and delete half of the files inside the folder. \n",
    "5. Check the result \n",
    "o Recount and display the remaining number of files after deletion.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Notes</b> <br>\n",
    "• File deletion must be random. <br>\n",
    "• The function should print clear messages showing each step and its result. <br>\n",
    "• Use Python standard libraries such as os and random. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Outcome \n",
    "After running the function:<br> \n",
    "• Files are created successfully.<br> \n",
    "• Half of them are randomly removed. <br>\n",
    "• The final number of files is displayed correctly. <br>"
